## Question 1
- Code for this question exists in this directory as `Lab_1.java`.

## Question 2
Using the original nucleotide frequency probabilities of 0.25: I expect the 3-mer `AAA` to appear roughly 16 times in 1000 randomly generated  3-mers.

> P(nt=A)^3 * 1000 3-mers:

> 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 1000 = 15.625 = 16

The observed frequency of `AAA` is between 10 and 14 after five attempts, with `AAA` appearing 2 times.  

## Question 3
Using the same math from above, the expected frequency of the 3-mer `AAA` is 1.728, or roughly 2 in 1000 randomly generated 3-mers. 

> 0.12 * 0.12 * 0.12 * 1000 = 1.728 = 2

The observed frequency is between 0 and 3 after five attempts, with `AAA` appearing 3 times.
